It is a place where earth and sky seem to merge, where the vastness humbles you. Visitors stand on the brink, dwarfed by nature, each of them embracing the wonder and weight of this view that steals both breath and words.</div>

                    <div class="image-description">Here, at the precipice, where awe meets danger, my brother Knowlton sits—boots dangling above the sheer drop. They often warned us not to stand too close to the edge, for the wind and wonder could play tricks on balance, pulling you toward the void. Once, a woman lost her footing here, teetering on the brink of tragedy. In that moment, it was Knowlton who reached out, grounding her in the solidity of the cliff, pulling her back from the grasp of an unwanted fate. It’s moments like these that make us remember just how fragile and fleeting safety can be at the edge of wonder.</div>

The sun warms our backs as we rest on the stones below, a pause in time amidst this piece of history. The carved wood, the grassy field, and the simplicity of the moment remind me that sometimes, it's the quietest scenes that hold the most meaning.</div>

His room, a gallery of memories, every inch of the walls covered with photos—snapshots of lives, moments, and adventures that framed his journey. It was like standing in the middle of a story told through images, surrounded by the past as we playfully posed, illustrating our strength and stature.</div>

I remember nights like this, when I would wander into my parents’ room, confused by the light streaming through the windows, even though the clock read 11pm. It felt as though the world refused to sleep, bathed in a soft, northern glow. Those long summer nights seemed to stretch on forever, a gentle reminder that in this place, time followed its own rhythm, just as I did.</div>

                    <div class="image-description">This was our home, standing quietly in the glow of fading light. In that living room, we’d gather and watch as wild reindeer, graceful and uninvited, wandered through the driveway garden, nibbling at the roses. They came as if they owned the place, leaving us in awe of the beauty that surrounded our everyday lives. So many memories bloomed here—just like the roses—small moments that filled the air with laughter, warmth, and the soft hum of life. Each corner of this house holds a piece of us, etched into the walls and garden forever.</div>

                    <div class="image-description">This house wasn’t just walls and windows; it was the stage for our wildest adventures. The second-story balcony, while meant for quiet moments, became our launching pad. We’d leap off, flying through the air onto the trampoline below, feeling weightless for a split second before bouncing back up, laughing all the way. Sometimes, we’d shoot basketballs mid-air, challenging ourselves with trick shots only kids could dream up. Sure, there were hospital trips—a few too many, perhaps—but the thrill, the joy, and the laughter were worth every bruise and broken bone. Those memories, made in the heat of youthful courage, were priceless.</div>

                    <div class="image-description">This was one of our hytte, one of three, scattered across the Norwegian wilderness. Each visit felt like an escape into the heart of nature, where we belonged just as much as the wildlife we befriended, knowing this was their home too. With no TV or smartphones, we found warmth in the bunk beds stacked high, and spent hours around board games like Yahtzee and Monopoly. The silence outside was filled with the crunch of mountain bike tires on rocky trails or the steady rhythm of our boots as we hiked. One memory, so surreal it's hard to believe it was ever mine, was the freedom to explore completely unsupervised. I once ventured off alone and after a couple hours of hiking, I found a kind family who welcomed me in, fed me lamb chops, and sent me on my way—no panic, no fear. Just a trust that this was what we were made for. That freedom to explore shaped me, and the solitude built a quiet strength I still hold dear. </div>

                    <div class="image-description">One funny memory from this hytte was on my birthday, as I was out picking blueberries and strawberries for the cake. I got a call from one of my brothers, telling me it was getting late and dinner was ready. So, I began heading back inside. As I opened the door, I was met with a fierce growl. There, in the middle of our living room, stood a massive grizzly bear. I gasped and jumped, and to this day, I swear my feet spun around like in a cartoon, running before the rest of my body caught up or even hit the ground. Blueberries and strawberries painted the cabin walls from the ceiling to the floor. I then slammed the door and bolted, but unfortunately, I was already far passed the first step on the staircase when gravity finally caught up with me, landing me at the bottom of the stairs. For a moment, I thought it was the end—until I heard hysterical laughter coming from the room with the "bear."<br><br>I realized it was a prank. Walking back up, I found my second oldest brother, Christen, pulling the grizzly bear rug off himself, laughing with my other three siblings, Knowlton, Elisa and Amy, while picking up the berries I had scattered in panic. </div>

                    <div class="image-description">Surrounded by the quiet majesty of Norway’s mountains and wilderness, It was in the Hyttes that we spent our summers picking berries, hiking the rugged trails, and having memorable encounters—But it wasn't all laughs and pranks. Some memories were of adventure and near mishaps, like when my mom and I were exploring and came upon some cute small structures that resembled houses, then once too close, quickly realized we were in the middle of a Bee farm. We sprinted for our lives, dodging the bees with my mom laughing until she realized one was stuck in her hair. I'm not sure if you've ever struggled with dancing, but some pro advice I learned that day, is that if ever you get a bee stuck in your hair, believe me, dancing come naturally. I had to pick it out while we nervously hoped we wouldn't get stung. Luckily though, we made it back safely, another adventure etched into our memory.<br><br>Winters were no less magical. Voss became our snowy playground, where I found my passion for skiing, zipping down the slopes with confidence, collecting competition victories as I went, all while storing bacon from the resorts in my pockets for a quick snack on the slopes. Every corner of this wild, free landscape holds memories that shaped who I am today—whether it was the thrill of skiing or the simple joy of sitting on the porch after a day of mountain biking. Each visit to the hyttes offered something new, another story to tell, another moment of pure freedom in the heart of nature.</div>

We traveled across the US, sharing in the excitement of innovation and creating unforgettable experiences along the way. A fun memory from this time was how the majority of our team had never flown before and were anxious during turbulence. I’d pull out my ukulele and start playing "Ride" by 21 Pilots. After the mix of laughter and playful boos, song requests would roll in, and I’d play to help ease the nerves. Those impromptu jam sessions in the clouds became a cherished part of the adventure.</div>
