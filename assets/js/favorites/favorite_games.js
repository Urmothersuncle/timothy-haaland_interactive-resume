I'll also, just save everyone some time and not get into a rant of how sand is eternal.<br><br>Truths:<br>1. I love the mountains. Ever since I was little, the mountains always gave me such a sense of wonder. Fun fact: When I was just 7 years old, my family lived in a beautiful 3-story mansion atop a hill nestled among a bowl of mountains. We used to venture through the forest to a nearby large lake, where everyone had claimed their own sizable boulder. However, I opted to claim a small cave that could only be accessed by scaling a nearby tree. This easily made living near the mountains a cherished experience of mine.<br>2. I love the forest. Despite its dangers and the presence of ticks, venturing through the woods alone and with family was one of my favorite pastimes. Not-so-fun-fact: In the forest, I used to journey to reach my small cave, cow patties would easily be mistaken for tree stumps. Unfortunately, this was a lesson I learned the hard way.",

Whether itâ€™s diving into a personal project like coding a website or tackling something new like understanding circuit maps to fix a dryer, I thrive on gaining knowledge and utilizing it to create new ideas. I also love learning how to build 3D printed projects and solar-powered robot cars with my daughters. I have a blast teaching them what I've learned, and they soak it all in like a sponge.

While working offshore, there were times we only worked seven days out of our 28-day rotation due to hurricanes in the Gulf. It was also during this time that I honed my Cornhole skills, even with the boat swaying in rough weather.<br><br>As for singing, I had the privilege of performing (singing, dancing, and acting) on stage and tour for four years, getting paid per song.
